Intent
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses.
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders.


Problem

Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate no reuse of common interface or implementation. 
If a change common to both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.

Check list

Examine the algorithm, and decide which steps are standard and which steps are peculiar to each of the current classes.
Define a new abstract base class to host the "don't call us, we'll call you" framework.
Move the shell of the algorithm (now called the "template method") and the definition of all standard steps to the new base class.
Define a placeholder or "hook" method in the base class for each step that requires many different implementations. 
	This method can host a default implementation – or – it can be defined as abstract (Java) or pure virtual (C++).
Invoke the hook method(s) from the template method.
Each of the existing classes declares an "is-a" relationship to the new abstract base class.
Remove from the existing classes all the implementation details that have been moved to the base class.
The only details that will remain in the existing classes will be the implementation details peculiar to each derived class.


Demo: digital signature
steps:
hash message, encrypt hashed message then encoding, appended signature to the end of message
