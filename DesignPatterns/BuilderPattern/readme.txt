Builder Design Pattern
Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.
Problem

An application needs to create the elements of a complex aggregate. 
The specification for the aggregate exists on secondary storage and one of many representations needs to be built in primary storage.


Check list

Decide if a common input and many possible representations (or outputs) is the problem at hand.
Encapsulate the parsing of the common input in a Reader class.
Design a standard protocol for creating all possible output representations. Capture the steps of this protocol in a Builder interface.
Define a Builder derived class for each target representation.
The client creates a Reader object and a Builder object, and registers the latter with the former.
The client asks the Reader to "construct".
The client asks the Builder to return the result.

Demo:
Robot builder: all components of a robot should be built before the robot came out
