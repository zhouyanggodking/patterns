Intent
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.
The "View" part of Model-View-Controller.

Check list

Differentiate between the core (or independent) functionality and the optional (or dependent) functionality.
Model the independent functionality with a "subject" abstraction.
Model the dependent functionality with an "observer" hierarchy.
The Subject is coupled only to the Observer base class.
The client configures the number and type of Observers.
Observers register themselves with the Subject.
The Subject broadcasts events to all registered Observers.
The Subject may "push" information at the Observers, or, the Observers may "pull" the information they need from the Subject.
