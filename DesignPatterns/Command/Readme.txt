Intent:
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
Promote "invocation of a method on an object" to full object status
An object-oriented callback

Check list:
Define a Command interface with a method signature like execute().
Create one or more derived classes that encapsulate some subset of the following: a "receiver" object, the method to invoke, the arguments to pass.
Instantiate a Command object for each deferred execution request.
Pass the Command object from the creator (aka sender) to the invoker (aka receiver).
The invoker decides when to execute().

Demo on CommandPattern:
Use remote controller to control TV.
TV has two categories SonyTv and PhilipsTv


Rules of thumb

Chain of Responsibility, Command, Mediator, and Observer, address how you can decouple senders and receivers, but with different trade-offs. Command normally specifies a sender-receiver connection with a subclass.
Chain of Responsibility can use Command to represent requests as objects.
Command and Memento act as magic tokens to be passed around and invoked at a later time. In Command, the token represents a request; in Memento, it represents the internal state of an object at a particular time. Polymorphism is important to Command, but not to Memento because its interface is so narrow that a memento can only be passed as a value.
Command can use Memento to maintain the state required for an undo operation.
MacroCommands can be implemented with Composite.
A Command that must be copied before being placed on a history list acts as a Prototype.
Two important aspects of the Command pattern: interface separation (the invoker is isolated from the receiver), time separation (stores a ready-to-go processing request that's to be stated later).
